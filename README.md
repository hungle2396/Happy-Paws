## I Want To Open It Using My Editor
1. First you have to install node.js
2. Then, in your terminal, type in "npm install" in your editor for the terminal to download the npm_module
3. After that, in your terminal, type in "npm run build", webpack will build a dist folder with all the necessary files to display it on the browser
4. Finally, in your terminal, type in "npm run start", this will automatically open a localhost:3000 or localhost:8080 and render the website
